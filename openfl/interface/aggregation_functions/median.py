            local_tensors(list[openfl.utilities.LocalTensor]): List of local tensors to aggregate.
            db_iterator: iterator over history of all tensors. Columns:
                - 'tensor_name': name of the tensor.
                    Examples for `torch.nn.Module`s: 'conv1.weight', 'fc2.bias'.
                - 'round': 0-based number of round corresponding to this tensor.
                - 'tags': tuple of tensor tags. Tags that can appear:
                    - 'model' indicates that the tensor is a model parameter.
                    - 'trained' indicates that tensor is a part of a training result.
                        These tensors are passed to the aggregator node after local learning.
                    - 'aggregated' indicates that tensor is a result of aggregation.
                        These tensors are sent to collaborators for the next round.
                    - 'delta' indicates that value is a difference between rounds
                        for a specific tensor.
                    also one of the tags is a collaborator name
                    if it corresponds to a result of a local task.

                - 'nparray': value of the tensor.
            tensor_name: name of the tensor
            fl_round: round number
            tags: tuple of tags for this tensor
